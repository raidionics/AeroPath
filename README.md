## [Brief intro](https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath#brief-intro)

This repository contains the AeroPath dataset described in ["_AeroPath: An airway segmentation benchmark dataset with challenging pathology_"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01138).  A web application was also developed in the study, to enable users to easily test our deep learning model on their own data. The application was developed using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app) for the frontend and the segmentation is performed using the [Raidionics](https://raidionics.github.io/) backend.

The dataset is made openly available at Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10069289).

## [Dataset structure](https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath#data-structure)

The dataset contains 27 CTs with corresponding airways and lung annotations. The folder structure is described below:

```
└── AeroPath.zip
    ├── README.md
    └──  AeroPath/
        ├── 1/
        │   ├── 1_CT_HR.nii.gz
        │   ├── 1_CT_HR_label_airways.nii.gz
        │   └── 1_CT_HR_label_lungs.nii.gz

```

## [Development](https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath#development)

### [Docker](https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath#docker)

Alternatively, you can deploy the software locally. Note that this is only relevant for development purposes. Simply dockerize the app and run it:

```
docker build -t AeroPath .
docker run -it -p 7860:7860 AeroPath
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in your favourite internet browser to view the demo.

### [Python](https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath#python)

It is also possible to run the app locally without Docker. Just setup a virtual environment and run the app.
Note that the current working directory would need to be adjusted based on where `AeroPath` is located on disk.

```
git clone https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath.git
cd AeroPath/

virtualenv -python3 venv --clear
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./demo/requirements.txt

python demo/app.py --cwd ./
```

## [Citation](https://github.com/raidionics/AeroPath#citation)

If you found the dataset and/or web application relevant in your research, please cite the following reference:
```
@misc{støverud2023aeropath,
      title={{AeroPath: An airway segmentation benchmark dataset with challenging pathology}},

```

The dataset is hosted at Zenodo, so you should also cite the following:
```
@dataset{hofstad_2023_10069289,
  author       = {Hofstad, Erlend and
                  Bouget, David and

  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10069289}
}
```

The web application is using the [Raidionics]() backend, thus, also consider citing:
```
